            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">People Will Always Need A Place To Live!</strong>
            The American dream of home ownership will thrive even when the market is a mess and the government has instituted new plans to make it easy to buy in an effort to turn the economy around and create a housing market.
            <br><br>
            Fortunately it&#8217;s working as evidence by over 40% of all sales made today are with government backed loans. Houses are selling and will continue to sell regardless of the economy. You can&#8217;t shut down the American dream of home ownership.
            <br><br>
            That&#8217;s where I come in. My business involves buying some of the bank owned homes, renovating them and selling to buyers taking advantage of multiple financing plans available for first time buyers.
            <br><br>
            Sometimes I cash out within a few months and other times I hold for a few years. Regardless of my exit there&#8217;s one common denominator pertaining to all my transactions. They require cash to purchase and rehab and that&#8217;s where you come in.
            <br><br>
            There is a safe alternative to the stock market for you to consider. The alternative is…
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Private Mortgage Loans</strong>
            You can loan money, secured by a first or second mortgage or trustdeed that will not only give you the safety you want but will also give you a high yield.
            <br><br>
            Let&#8217;s discuss the pros and cons of loaning on houses. First, let&#8217;s clarify what kind of loans. I&#8217;m not talking about high loan-to-value loans the banks and savings and loans make but very low loan-to-value loans. By that, I mean no higher than 65% of the value of the property securing the loan. This means if a house appraises for $150,000 you wouldn&#8217;t make a loan for higher than $97,500. That&#8217;s a 65% loan to value.
            <br><br>
            It&#8217;s obvious why this is a much safer approach than most lending institutions take. The banks make loans at an 80, 90, or even 95% loan to value ratio. They just don&#8217;t have any cushion in case of default.
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, when you&#8217;re dealing with a 65% maximum LTV there is so much equity above your loan your collateral is your security.
            <br><br>

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        A: No one. There will only be one, which is the principal plus accrued interest at the time I sell. That eliminates the hassle of payment collection on your part and helps me with cash flow. You simply wire the money to the attorney and forget it until you get a big check later, sort of like buying stocks.

My real estate isn&#8217;t going anywhere and will always have value. We can&#8217;t say that about stocks.

You tell me what you want to put out and I&#8217;ll plug you into a deal that matches. Of course the more money available the easier that becomes.

It costs nothing to transfer but will take about 10 days. Once it&#8217;s done you&#8217;ll alert me and I&#8217;ll find you a deal.

                            A: You can, but I&#8217;ll do everything I can to discourage it because the house will likely need rehabbed, which is why I can buy it cheap enough for your 65% loan to cover all the costs. I&#8217;d rather you just let me do my job. Remember, you&#8217;ll get a current appraisal showing work to be done and value once completed, title insurance and fire insurance and you&#8217;ll lend 65% max. You&#8217;re covered!

                            A first mortgage verification (if you&#8217;re making a second). <br>
                            A title insurance policy for the amount of your loan insuring you against any title defects. <br>

                            A: I&#8217;ll expect you to wire the funds to the escrow account within 48 hours. We won&#8217;t start the closing paperwork until they appear. If that&#8217;s a problem at the time, we&#8217;ll deal with it on a case by case basis and I&#8217;ll try to accommodate. Frankly the quick response is for my benefit. You see, until the funds are provable, I&#8217;m never sure they are coming. I know you understand. Once your funds arrive, I&#8217;ll know not to call other investors. I won&#8217;t even request them until all due diligence is done and we&#8217;re ready to close within a few days thereafter.

                As you can see, making private loans should be safe and rewarding with no hassle and fear of declining stock value. Your return is the interest rate on your note and it won&#8217;t change.
